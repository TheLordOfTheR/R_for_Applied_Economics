# R for Applied Economics
Welcome to the GitHub repository for "R for Applied Economics"! This project is a series of posts on medium where we will provide a comprehensive introduction to using R for applied economics and show you how to extract, download, prepare, clean, process, manipulate, and even store data, as well as automate workflows. Our goal is to make this journey educational, exciting, and inspiring.
